# PubMix
## Johnny Wong

### What will this project try to accomplish?
PubMix will be able to allow it's users to manage their own workouts and their daily
to-do lists. It will provide checklists and enable users to add/update/remove what they
have to do.

### How will this project accomplish these goals?
This will be a single page application, primarily testing my JavaScript abilities.
BootStrap will be used as the front-end-framework.
EDIT: Will need to use Flask as back-end.
